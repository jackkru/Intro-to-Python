    "So far you know the basics of individual instructions and that a program is just a series of instructions. But the real strength of programming is not just executing one instruction after another. Based on how the **expressions** evaluate, the program can decide to **skip instructions**, **repeat** them, or **choose** one of several instructions to run. In fact, you almost never want your programs to start from the first line of code and simply execute every line, straight to the end. **Control flow statements** can decide which Python instructions to execute under which **conditions**.\n",

If he joins group 1 first, then he goes into the Klimperkasten and wants to drink at least 5 tequilas there before he moves on to the Steigenberger. But if he joints group 2 first, then he goes into the Steigenberger and wants to drink at least 5 tequilas there before he moves on to the Klimperkasten. A Tequila costs 4 € in the Klimperkasten and 10€ in the Steigenberger. Define budget, prices and the first group as variables. Prompt where Hans goes, what he drinks and how much money he has left. How does Hans' evening go?\n",
